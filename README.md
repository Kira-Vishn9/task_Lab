# Module 1

## What should be done

### Prerequisites:

- Get familiar with [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/)
- Learn about [Anti-patterns](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/anti-patterns/)
- Read about [Writing better Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/better-gherkin/)
- Review the application on [Trello](https://trello.com/)

### Home Task

Write 8 scenarios (Test cases) in the Gherkin syntax using the Trello site. Each scenario must contain at least 4 steps.  
The required keywords for each scenario must be: 
- Scenario: ...... 
- Given ...... 
- When ...... 
- Then.......

### Recommendation

These scenarios should relate to the following areas:
- Sign up/Sign in
- Edit user profile
- Create a board
- Search for a board
- Create a list
- Create a card
- Card filtering
- Edit Workspace

### Evaluation Criteria (Pass Rate is 70%)

Here’s the list of actions which result in a reduction of the overall mark for a completed task:
- Less than 8 scenarios are written (-1 scenario = –15%)
- Not all required keywords used (scenario with mistakes = –5%)
- Scenario with antipatterns (scenario with mistakes = –5%)
